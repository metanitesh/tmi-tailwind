              You can stay focused on the breath more or less continuously, but
              attention still shifts rapidly back and forth between the breath
              and various distractions. Whenever a distraction becomes the
              primary focus of your attention, it pushes the meditation object
              into the background. This is called gross distraction. But when
              the mind grows calm, there tends to be another problem, strong
              dullness. To deal with both of these challenges, you develop
              continuous introspective awareness to alert you to their presence.
